# Ice Robotics 2023

## Info

This repository was for our 2022-2023 Power Play robot Glacier.

We use a fairly standard roadrunner and EasyOpenCV system, with a custom dependency injection system. In retrospect, the dependency injector added a layer of complexity unfit for the majority of teams.

## Setup

- Hardware map in [robot-configuration.txt](./robot-configuration.txt)
- Standard Android Studio Install
- Upload `libOpenCvAndroid453.so` from the [Open CV Repackaged repository](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenCV-Repackaged/blob/e6b694b2d601213a0adcca724bb40dadf30244fe/doc/native_libs/arm64-v8a/libOpenCvAndroid453.so) into the FIRST folder on the USB storage of the Robot
  Controller
